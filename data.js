The dim light flickered above the bathroom mirror, casting jagged shadows that danced in the corners of my vision. I leaned in closer, squinting at the reflection staring back at me, a worn-out face framed by a tousle of dark hair, the remnants of a once sharp jawline softened by the scruff of two days stubble. My wiry body swayed slightly as I tried to keep my balance, the remnants of cheap bourbon tugging at my limbs like a drunken lover unwilling to let go.
&#34;Look at you&#34; I muttered, addressing the face in the mirror. &#34;Just a washed-up alcoholic in a dive that smells like spilled whiskey and regret.&#34; My eyes, bloodshot and weary, matched the dull sheen of the metallic fixtures around me. They were the kind of eyes that had seen too many dark alleys and dirty secrets, and tonight, they were searching for answers in the bottom of a glass, answers that always seemed just out of reach.
With a resigned sigh, I raked my fingers through my hair, which felt as dishevelled as my thoughts. A pretty average looking guy, they&#39;d say. Just another face in the crowd. But to me, that was perfect. I was blending in when all the others were standing out, the unnoticed justicar in a shadowy realm of dames and deceit. A smile tugged at my lips, bitter as the whiskey still clinging to my taste buds. I straightened up and looked back in the mirror, hoping that maybe, just for a second, the reflection might show me a glimmer of the man I used to be. The fresh faced Schola grad who was blissfully unaware of the darkness skulking every corner of the Imperium.

I was a sharp-eyed recruit once, bright with promise, but the promise of this job is a lie. A lie I&#39;ve sold to myself more times than I care to count. My days are a haze of false identities, fake smiles, and forged alliances. Every undercover op leaves another scar on the soul, another sliver of the person I used to be. 
The irony is, I&#39;m good at it. Too good. I can talk my way into the most dangerous syndicates and whisper secrets out of the most guarded minds. It&#39;s what they need me for, the thing I was trained for, but you can&#39;t live a lie without becoming one yourself.
Trust? That&#39;s a luxury I can&#39;t afford. You spend too long pretending to be someone else, and you start losing grip on who you are. The lines blur, faces blend, and sometimes, when I close my eyes, I&#39;m not entirely sure who I am anymore. The worst part? The silence. It&#39;s not the gunfights, or the double-crosses that get to you, it&#39;s the quiet after. The stillness, that&#39;s when the thoughts creep in, picking at the edges of your mind like vultures on a corpse.
I used to have principles. Justice, duty, they were more than words back then. But now, after years crawling through the muck of human depravity, those ideals are hard to keep hold of. I get the job done, don&#39;t get me wrong, but at what cost? Every bust, every betrayal chips away a little more of what&#39;s left of me.
I don&#39;t kid myself about redemption. I&#39;m too far gone for that. But I keep moving, keep hunting the traitors, the scum, because if I stop? The doubts and the questions catch up, and when that happens, there&#39;s no running.

Combat? Yeah, I&#39;m damn good at it. Comes with the territory. The Emperor&#39;s justice isn&#39;t handed out with words alone, and in my line of work, a split-second can be the difference between walking out alive or being another body in the gutter. I didn&#39;t spend all those years at the Schola for nothing. They trained me to fight, taught me every technique from close-quarters to ranged combat, every dirty trick in the book. I can snap a neck as easily as I can dismantle a laspistol, and when it comes to a firefight, I don&#39;t miss.
Thing is, the fighting? That&#39;s the easy part. Pull the trigger, swing the baton, break the bone: quick, decisive, clean. The real skill, the one that keeps me alive more than my fists, is reading people. They don&#39;t teach you that in the Schola. You learn it out here, on the streets, through experience. You learn to see the flicker in someone&#39;s eyes, the tension in their shoulders when they&#39;re about to pull a blade or betray you. It&#39;s all about staying one step ahead. Combat might be instinct, but survival? That&#39;s a game of wits, and I&#39;ve been playing it long enough to know the rules.
I&#39;ve spent years undercover, running ops that most Arbites wouldn&#39;t touch. That&#39;s my edge. I can blend in, become someone else entirely. A smuggler, a merc, a street-level thug, it doesn&#39;t matter. I slip into those roles like a second skin. When I&#39;m working a case, I know when to talk, when to stay silent, and when to disappear. Some of my colleagues think I have some kind of sixth sense, but it&#39;s just survival instincts honed from years in the field.
But in the end, it always seems to come back to fighting. No matter how many names I take, or how many lies I spin. There&#39;s a kind  of comfort in knowing that when it all comes crashing down, I&#39;m the one who walks away. Because when it&#39;s just me and them in a dark alley, I&#39;m the better fighter, I have to be.

<b><u>Backstory</u></b>

I was five when they brought me in, just a half-starved kid with no name, no past, just another orphan swept up by the Imperium&#39;s endless wars. From what little I remember, I was born on some backwater hive world. I don&#39;t know if my parents were workers or gang scum, probably both if I had to guess. People in the underhives are never clean. Not when clean means either starving in the streets or giving what little you can scrape together to some meathead for &#34;protection.&#34; 
What I do remember, though, is the fear. There was always fear. Fear of the gangs, fear of the Enforcers who would sweep in and clean out whole blocks, fear of the tainted whispers you&#39;d sometimes hear if you listened too closely in the dark.
One day, the Enforcers came to our sector, and this time they didn&#39;t leave. They came to purge the filth, the corruption and anything else that was nearby. I remember the sound of gunfire, the way the air felt heavy with ash and smoke. My parents? Gone. Maybe they were shot, maybe they ran, maybe they turned on each other when things got desperate. I don&#39;t know, I was five. It doesn&#39;t matter though, they weren&#39;t there when someone found me, huddled in a corner. Lucky for me, they decided I wasn&#39;t worth the bullet. Instead, they sent me to the Schola. Just another orphan to mould into a weapon for the Emperor. 
The Abbots don&#39;t care who you were, where you came from. All they care about is what they can make you into. And I became exactly what they needed, a tool, sharpened and honed for a purpose I had no say in. I left my old life behind, buried whatever memories I had and moved on. But sometimes, when the nights are quiet and the whiskey runs dry, I can still hear the thud of autogun fire and the cries of the forgotten souls left behind.
