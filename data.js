The dim light flickered above the bathroom mirror, casting jagged shadows that danced in the corners of my vision. I leaned in closer, squinting at the reflection staring back at me, a worn-out face framed by a tousle of dark hair, the remnants of a once sharp jawline softened by the scruff of two days stubble. My wiry body swayed slightly as I tried to keep my balance, the remnants of cheap bourbon tugging at my limbs like a drunken lover unwilling to let go.
&#34;Look at you&#34; I muttered, addressing the face in the mirror. &#34;Just a washed-up alcoholic in a dive that smells like spilled whiskey and regret.&#34; My eyes, bloodshot and weary, matched the dull sheen of the metallic fixtures around me. They were the kind of eyes that had seen too many dark alleys and dirty secrets, and tonight, they were searching for answers in the bottom of a glass, answers that always seemed just out of reach.
With a resigned sigh, I raked my fingers through my hair, which felt as dishevelled as my thoughts. A pretty average looking guy, they&#39;d say. Just another face in the crowd. But to me, that was perfect. I was blending in when all the others were standing out, the unnoticed justicar in a shadowy realm of dames and deceit. A smile tugged at my lips, bitter as the whiskey still clinging to my taste buds. I straightened up and looked back in the mirror, hoping that maybe, just for a second, the reflection might show me a glimmer of the man I used to be. The fresh faced Schola grad who was blissfully unaware of the darkness skulking every corner of the Imperium.

+++ TRANSCRIPT BEGINS +++
I was a sharp-eyed recruit once, bright with promise, but the promise of this job is a lie. A lie I&#39;ve sold to myself more times than I care to count. My days are a haze of false identities, fake smiles, and forged alliances. Every undercover op leaves another scar on the soul, another sliver of the person I used to be. 
The irony is, I&#39;m good at it. Too good. I can talk my way into the most dangerous syndicates and whisper secrets out of the most guarded minds. It&#39;s what they need me for, the thing I was trained for, but you can&#39;t live a lie without becoming one yourself.
Trust? That&#39;s a luxury I can&#39;t afford. You spend too long pretending to be someone else, and you start losing grip on who you are. The lines blur, faces blend, and sometimes, when I close my eyes, I&#39;m not entirely sure who I am anymore. The worst part? The silence. It&#39;s not the gunfights, or the double-crosses that get to you, it&#39;s the quiet after. The stillness, that&#39;s when the thoughts creep in, picking at the edges of your mind like vultures on a corpse.
I used to have principles. Justice, duty, they were more than words back then. But now, after years crawling through the muck of human depravity, those ideals are hard to keep hold of. I get the job done, don&#39;t get me wrong, but at what cost? Every bust, every betrayal chips away a little more of what&#39;s left of me.
I don&#39;t kid myself about redemption. I&#39;m too far gone for that. But I keep moving, keep hunting the traitors, the scum, because if I stop? The doubts and the questions catch up, and when that happens, there&#39;s no running.

Combat? Yeah, I&#39;m damn good at it. Comes with the territory. The Emperor&#39;s justice isn&#39;t handed out with words alone, and in my line of work, a split-second can be the difference between walking out alive or being another body in the gutter. I didn&#39;t spend all those years at the Schola for nothing. They trained me to fight, taught me every technique from close-quarters to ranged combat, every dirty trick in the book. I can snap a neck as easily as I can dismantle a laspistol, and when it comes to a firefight, I don&#39;t miss.
Thing is, the fighting? That&#39;s the easy part. Pull the trigger, swing the baton, break the bone: quick, decisive, clean. The real skill, the one that keeps me alive more than my fists, is reading people. They don&#39;t teach you that in the Schola. You learn it out here, on the streets, through experience. You learn to see the flicker in someone&#39;s eyes, the tension in their shoulders when they&#39;re about to pull a blade or betray you. It&#39;s all about staying one step ahead. Combat might be instinct, but survival? That&#39;s a game of wits, and I&#39;ve been playing it long enough to know the rules.
I&#39;ve spent years undercover, running ops that most Arbites wouldn&#39;t touch. That&#39;s my edge. I can blend in, become someone else entirely. A smuggler, a merc, a street-level thug, it doesn&#39;t matter. I slip into those roles like a second skin. When I&#39;m working a case, I know when to talk, when to stay silent, and when to disappear. Some of my colleagues think I have some kind of sixth sense, but it&#39;s just survival instincts honed from years in the field.
But in the end, it always seems to come back to fighting. No matter how many names I take, or how many lies I spin. There&#39;s a kind  of comfort in knowing that when it all comes crashing down, I&#39;m the one who walks away. Because when it&#39;s just me and them in a dark alley, I&#39;m the better fighter, I have to be.

<b><u>Backstory</u></b>

+++ TRANSCRIPT BEGINS +++
I was five when they brought me in, just a half-starved kid with no name, no past, just another orphan swept up by the Imperium&#39;s endless wars. From what little I remember, I was born on some backwater hive world. I don&#39;t know if my parents were workers or gang scum, probably both if I had to guess. People in the underhives are never clean. Not when clean means either starving in the streets or giving what little you can scrape together to some meathead for &#34;protection.&#34; 
What I do remember, though, is the fear. There was always fear. Fear of the gangs, fear of the Enforcers who would sweep in and clean out whole blocks, fear of the tainted whispers you&#39;d sometimes hear if you listened too closely in the dark.
One day, the Enforcers came to our sector, and this time they didn&#39;t leave. They came to purge the filth, the corruption and anything else that was nearby. I remember the sound of gunfire, the way the air felt heavy with ash and smoke. My parents? Gone. Maybe they were shot, maybe they ran, maybe they turned on each other when things got desperate. I don&#39;t know, I was five. It doesn&#39;t matter though, they weren&#39;t there when someone found me, huddled in a corner. Lucky for me, they decided I wasn&#39;t worth the bullet. Instead, they sent me to the Schola. Just another orphan to mould into a weapon for the Emperor. 
The Abbots don&#39;t care who you were, where you came from. All they care about is what they can make you into. And I became exactly what they needed, a tool, sharpened and honed for a purpose I had no say in. I left my old life behind, buried whatever memories I had and moved on. But sometimes, when the nights are quiet and the whiskey runs dry, I can still hear the thud of autogun fire and the cries of the forgotten souls left behind.

Alara Voss. Now, there’s a name that sticks with you. Sharp as a razor, dangerous as a live krak grenade, and impossible to read. She was the lead detective for the Bureau, and I trusted her with my life. Cold, calculating, always three steps ahead of everyone else in the room. 
She had this way of getting what she wanted, whether it was information, trust, or someone’s life, all without ever letting them know if they were playing her game or she was playing theirs. It’s like she walked through the world knowing every move before it was made, like she could see the web of deceit stretching out around her and knew exactly where to pull the threads.
She had the looks to match, too. That kind of beauty that lured you in, wrapped around you like a silk noose, and before you knew it, you were hooked. It wasn’t just her looks, though, it was the way she carried herself. Every step, every glance was calculated, like she had the universe in her sights and knew exactly when to pull the trigger.
When we worked together, there was always this tension, like a coiled wire, ready to snap. Not because I didn’t trust her. Hell, I trusted Voss more than anyone. But with her, you always had to wonder: was she doing this because it was the right move, or because it served her own agenda? She had secrets, everyone in this line of work does, but with her, it felt like those secrets went deep. Real deep.
But damn, she was good at her job. If there was a lead to chase, she’d have it pinned down before the ink was dry on the reports. Her methods weren’t always clean, though. She had a way of getting into people’s heads, manipulating them, playing on their desires and fears. She’d play the role of the damsel, the ally, the lover, whatever got her closer to the truth. And more often than not, it worked. But I always wondered what it cost her.
Working with Voss was like dancing on the edge of a knife. You knew you could fall, but you couldn’t help but admire the precision, the grace of it all. There’s a darkness in her, though—a part of her that’s always looking for something more, something deeper. Whether it’s power, control, or just the thrill of the chase, I don’t know. But I do know this: if I ever needed someone to have my back, to get the job done no matter the cost, there’s no one I’d pick over her.

Caius Draven. If ever there was a man who looked like he was carved from a slab of ceramite, it’s him. Lead Proctor of the Bureau, and about as subtle as a powerfist to the face. 
Where Voss and I dealt in whispers, Draven dealt in force. He’s the muscle, plain and simple. A wall of a man, no-nonsense, straight to the point. You won’t catch him wasting time with mind games or deception. He doesn't need to.
Draven was the kind of guy you want around when things get ugly, and in our line of work, they always do. When a situation goes sideways, when negotiations fail, when all the talk and scheming has played out, that’s when Draven steps in with a swarm of Arbitrators. And when he does, it’s over fast. There’s no second guessing, no hesitation. He’s a hammer in a world full of nails, and Emperor help anyone who finds themselves on the wrong end of his swing.
He’s not just big, either, he’s smart in a way people don’t expect. Most take one look at the guy and figure he’s just another brute, someone to point in the right direction and hope he doesn’t break too much on his way through. But Draven’s been around long enough to know how to read a situation. He might not talk much, but when he does, you listen. The man has a way of cutting through the noise, boiling everything down to its essentials. You need that kind of clarity in this business.
There’s something comforting about Draven’s presence, though. When he’s with you, you feel like nothing can touch you. Not because you’re invincible, but because he is. I’ve seen him take down entire gangs with nothing but his fists and that grim, unflinching stare of his. Doesn’t matter if they’re armed to the teeth—he’s always the last one standing. And when Draven says he’s got your back, you know it’s not just words. The man’s loyalty is like his body, a rock: solid, unmovable, and unwavering.
But make no mistake, Draven isn’t the kind of guy who forgives easily. Cross him, or worse, fail him, and you’ll wish you hadn’t. He’s not cruel, not sadistic, but he’s got his own code. A simple one: you pull your weight, you follow orders, and you don’t waste time. 
If you’re on the other side of the law, there’s no mercy, no negotiations. Draven delivers the Emperor’s justice the way it was meant to be delivered: swift, brutal, and absolute.

Ian Danews, officially, he’s a reporter for The Imperial Times, a news organization that prides itself on keeping the Imperium informed. Unofficially? He’s on the Bureau’s payroll, and he’s got a knack for spinning narratives to suit our needs.
Ian plays the part of the affable journalist, always looking for the next big scoop, always digging for the truth. But that truth is malleable in his hands. He knows how to twist a story, how to paint a picture that serves our interests rather than the reality of it. Need to discredit a corrupt official? A few choice words from Ian can make them look like the worst kind of heretic. Need to bolster our image after a messy operation? Just give him a call, and he’ll write up a tale of heroism that even the most cynical of citizens would swallow whole.
But like all of us, Ian’s playing a dangerous game. He walks a tightrope between two worlds, one where he’s supposed to uphold the truth and another where he’s weaving lies for the Bureau’s sake. The strain of that duality can get to you. I’ve seen it in the way he sometimes stares into the distance, as if he’s wrestling with the very words he puts on paper. In a universe where loyalty is as fleeting as a spark in the void, Ian’s juggling identities, and it takes its toll.
There are times I wonder how long he can keep it up, how long before he loses himself in the stories he spins, the lives he manipulates. But for now, he’s invaluable. He’s the one who helps us keep tabs on the criminal underbelly, the one who feeds us information when we need it most. He’s got contacts, sources, and an ear to the ground.
In a way, he’s just like the rest of us. He knows the risks, knows he’s playing with fire, but the thrill of the chase keeps him going. And as long as he’s around, I know we’ll have our stories straight. Because in a world where truth is often stranger than fiction, it helps to have a good writer on your side.

The Mobile Investigations Bureau? That’s my baby. A project born out of necessity, not ambition. I didn’t ask for it, didn’t want it at first, but the Arbites brass had other ideas. They saw something in me, so they gave me a blank slate and told me to make it work.
The Bureau isn’t like your typical Arbites precincts, with their heavy fortifications and loud, iron-fisted crackdowns. No, this is different. We aren’t stationed in one place, we move. Always shifting, always adapting, like predators on the hunt. The idea is simple: bring the law to the lawless, dive deep into the murk of the underworld, and root out corruption from within. It’s undercover work, plain and simple, but on a larger scale. 
I built the Bureau from the ground up, structuring it so we could slip into any hive city, any planet, and disappear until the job was done. No uniforms, no chains of command. Just results. We would go after the kind of targets no one else could touch, the noble houses dealing in black-market xeno tech, the syndicates who had their claws deep in the local enforcers, and the heretics who corrupted from the shadows.
But here’s the thing about living in the shadows: you start to forget what the light feels like. We get so deep in the underbelly of the Imperium, sometimes it feels like we aren’t even Arbites anymore. Like we are becoming what we hunt. And maybe that’s why the Bureau works so well. We aren’t just enforcing the law, we were part of the chaos, pulling the strings, laying the traps.
It’s perfect, in its own broken way, but it takes a toll. On all of us. You can’t wade through that much filth without some of it sticking. And when you live a lie long enough, there’s always the danger that you might just start to forget who you were before.
